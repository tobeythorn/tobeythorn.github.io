				<header><h1>Philosophy</h1></header><header><h2>Let writers write</h2></header><p>Writers should be able to write without technology getting in the way. A writing syntax should not clutter a document, and it should not prevent writers from using certain characters without escapes. Writing software should let authors write freely.</p><header><h2>Find the essence of the art form</h2></header><p>Typographic formatting does not define a work of writing. George Orwell's 1984 is the same book no matter how you format it. Thus, plain text is the medium that gets writers closest to the essence of writing. Most manuscripts are written in plain text for this reason.</p><header><h2>Read between the lines</h2></header><p>No human has ever looked at a plain text document and had to ask, “Is that a title?” or “Is that a list?”. People have no problem identifying the parts of a plain text document. This observation suggests that markup languages are largely unnecessary, and that software should be able to parse documents that contain no markup whatsoever.</p><header><h2>Trust writers</h2></header><p>Writers know what punctuation they want to use. Features like “smart quotes” and “smart bullets” are stupid because they assume writers are incapable of making correct punctuation choices. Ironically, they also force writers to use incorrect punctuation.</p><p>Writers should be free to use “English”, 「Japanese」, «French», or any other type of quotation marks. When a writer uses "straight" quotation marks, we should trust that they specifically didn't want “curly” quotation marks.</p><p>We should also trust that writers are smart enough to know that asterisks (*) aren't bullet points (•). Writers should be free to use any kind of list marker they see fit.</p><header><h2>Less is more (semantic)</h2></header><p>A writing syntax should only cover elements that, when expressed through visual typography or spoken intonation and cadence, make it easier to understand a document. For example, readers benefit when elements like titles, lists, links, and block quotes are differentiated.</p><p>If a document contains only a few different types of elements, it's very easy to present them so that each is unmistakable. However, when you add too many different types of elements, it becomes impossible to communicate the difference to readers.</p><p>Non-semantic elements ought to be omitted. Traditional publishers understand this well. For example, it's no accident that most printed books contain no bold or italic elements within body text.</p><p>Sticking with a minimal set of meaningful elements types allows a typographer or speaker to create a clear distinction between the parts of a document.</p>
